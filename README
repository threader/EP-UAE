EP-UAE 0.00
=========================
This project merges the unreleased E-UAE 0.8.29 used by E-UAE PPC JIT
with P-UAE 2.10, with bugfixes and changes taken from everything from
P-UAE x.xx to FS-UAE and WinUAE with the goal of gaining recent features,
and improvements, intended to replace and extend E-UAE PPC JIT, with an
eye on the tickets on the sourceforge project page for that project.
First comes x86/X86_64, PPC JIT likely comes after unless I need 
ARM/AARCH64 to continue debugging in the wild or so.

Supported platforms ought remain: Amiga, *BSD, *nix and MacOSx.

Status:
Boots to Workbench, from floppy, with a basic configuration of chipmem,
but runs waay too fast, one bottom screen LED, if enabled in config tops
out at 999. Adding fast memory chokes the emulatior. 
It cannot use the a500-a600-a2000-cdtv kickstart, use a1200/3000/4000, 
this is tested and consistent with 1.3 to 3.1. Interesting things happen
when you use the a500-a600-a2000 kickstart and add any fastmem, it 
strangely goes beyond the green screen you get to if you run the 
configration that works with the a1200 kick and starts booting 
Workbench, something the a1200 kick does not with fastmem..
For some reason the mouse cursor is missing but you can click
and select things if you figure out where you are, runs too fast
for double clicking, but if you bog down your machine with say, 
compiling something, it slows down enough for this.
The Aros kickstart replacement is included/built in though I've not 
taken this beyond the kickstart.

Added the option --enable-m32 to the configure script to aid enabling JIT
and building a 32bit version, does not enable JIT, use --enable-jit. 
I've not added i386 multiarch to the machine I'm doing this project from
but I ensured it builds ofc.

Filesystem Isn't fixed yet, so I can't mount a directory, I've not tried
hardfiles or ISO's, don't throw files at it you care about in any case.
There are still warnings to be fixed.
GTK-GUI initial configuration window is AWOL and I've not spotted why.

With minimal config i mean: 
cpu_type=68020
chipset=aga
show_leds=true
kickstart_rom_file=Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.68 (1993)(Commodore)(A1200).rom
floppy0=Workbench v3.1 rev 40.42 (1994)(Commodore)(M10)(Disk 2 of 6)(Workbench)[!].adf

Compiling:
Either
./bronx_.sh or one of the linux_build_* scripts or so or configure to your liking:
./bootstrap.sh
./configure; make

Cleaning (mostly):
./release.sh 

E-UAE PowerPC JIT project
=========================

This project is a fork of the E-UAE Amiga emulation project. You can find the
original project's pages here:

http://www.rcdrummond.net/uae

Please also read the details of the original project in the included
README_original file.

The goal of the project is implementing Just-In-Time compiling for PowerPC
processors, using (some of) the already available intel x86 implementation.

For further details please have a look on the project blog:

You can find the actual project sources in the SourceForge project:

PUAE 2.1.00
============
PUAE tries to continue where E-UAE left off..
PUAE versioning is based on the merged WinUAE version..

All is done by:
	Mustafa 'GnoStiC' TUFAN (mustafa.tufan@gmail.com)

with OS-X fixes from:
	Steven 'xaind' Saunders

Thanks for the morale support:
	Dom 'Hungry Horace' Cresswell

Richard Drummond's E-UAE 0.8.29
============
(Left for Legacy info)
E-UAE is an Amiga emulator, a program that allows you to run software
designed for Amiga computers on other platforms, such as Linux or Mac
OS. It is based on UAE, the original Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, and
WinUAE, the Windows version of UAE. While it owes a huge debt to these
two great projects, E-UAE diverges from both, aiming to improve
performance and features on a variety of host platforms.

The name E-UAE stemmed from the fact that this project needed a name,
and, since it was an 'experimental' version of UAE, everybody was
calling it 'Experimental' UAE. While I have long since accepted that
moniker, I still don't intend the 'E' to mean anything it particular.
Although the project is currently 'experimental' - that is, it is a
long way from being anything close to finished - it should still be
robust enough to use.

E-UAE currently builds and runs - with varying degrees of supported
features - on Unix and Unix-like platforms (including Linux, Solaris
and Mac OS X), BeOS, AmigaOS and clones (including AmigaOS 3.x,
AmigaOS 4.0, MorphOS and AROS), and Windows (with Cygwin or MinGW32).

E-UAE is open-source software and is made available under the terms of
the GPL. See the COPYING file included with the E-UAE archive for
details.

E-UAE is based on the work of dozens of contributors including Bernd
Schmidt (the original author and maintainer of UAE), Bernie Meyer (the
author of the x86 JIT compiler), Toni Wilen (the current maintainer of
WinUAE), and many more.

Note that to make full use of E-UAE you will need access to an image
of some version of the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although E-UAE does include
a ROM emulation which may work with some old games). The Amiga
Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted material and may not be freely
distributed (so don't ask me for a copy). If you don't have an Amiga
from which you can legally make a ROM image, a selection of ROM images
are available for purchase online from Cloanto (publishers of the
Amiga Forever distribution). See http://www.amigaforever.com/

What's new since PUAE 0.0.0
======================
* Some many changes that i can't begin to mention here and now.


What's new since 0.8.29-WIP4
============================

New features:
* Added a command-line tool for generating blank hardfile images,
  called make_hdf
* Support for IPF floppy images now supported on OS X (and officially
  on AMD64/Linux now that libcapsimage is publically available). Go to
  http://www.softpres.org/ to download the plug-in.
* X-Arcade joystick supported (thanks to Robert Hurst for the patch).
* Build scripts now include a compile-time option --disable-fpu to
  disable building of FPU emulation.

Performance improvements:
* Some small custom chip and blitter tweaks merged from WinUAE 1.4.3.
* Some minor performance optimizations to blitter emulation, floppy
  controller emulation and rendering code. (Thanks to Mustafa Tufan,
  developer of PSP and GP2x ports of E-UAE, for a couple of these).

Bug fixes:
* Version 0.8.29-WIP4 broke the interrupt controller emulation. Fixed.
  This also makes Action Replay cartridge emulation work again.
* HDToolbox would hang when scanning for hard drives. Mostly fixed (I
  still have one unreproducible report of HDToolbox hanging).
* Hardfile emulation will no longer leak threads following a reset
  This also fixes crashes on exit on AmigaOS and clone hosts.
* Building on MacOS X no longer fails when building supporting tools
  like readdisk.
* Exiting E-UAE on OS X when started from Hi-Toro would cause 'load
  config file' dialog to be displayed. Fixed.
* BeOS sound driver was broken in recent changes to audio layer. Now
  fixed (fingers crossed).

Other:

* Removed support for 8-bit sound (since the official UAE did so).

Still to do
===========

The following features of UAE and/or WinUAE are not yet supported yet in PUAE. These include:
* Catweasel support (i don't have one so i can't test)


Known problems
==============

Some significant misfeatures that I know about and am/will be working
to fix (eventually):

* Only platforms supporting the GTK+ toolkit have a useable
  configuration GUI (and the GTK+ GUI is still incomplete). However,
  Mac OS X users may like to try Daniel Pimley's graphical front-end,
  Hi Toro. See http://www.pimley.net/projects/.
* JIT direct memory access only works on Linux/x86 and, by default,
  you may only emulate up to 32MB of direct ZIII RAM; select more than
  that and the JIT will fall back on indirect memory access and hence
  will be slower. This is due to a system limit on the size of a POSIX
  shared memory segment. You can overcome this limit my modifying the
  value of the procfs setting, /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax.
* Virtual filesystem doesn't support platforms which use UTF-8 for
  filenames (e.g., OS X, Linux with a UTF-8 locale, etc.). Filenames
  with characters outside of the core ASCII range will be mangled.
* The build scripts are a horrible, unmaintainable mess.
* Full documentation is lacking.


Using PUAE
===========
Documentation is a work-in-progress. See the docs directory.
